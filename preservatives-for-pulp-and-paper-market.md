<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Preservatives for Pulp and Paper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oxidizing</li><li>Non-Oxidizing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The preservatives for the pulp and paper market are categorized into oxidizing and non-oxidizing types. Oxidizing preservatives, such as chlorine dioxide and sodium hypochlorite, work by introducing reactive oxygen species that disrupt microbial cell functions, effectively controlling bacteria and fungi. Non-oxidizing preservatives, including quaternary ammonium compounds and isothiazolinones, inhibit microbial growth through different mechanisms, often targeting cellular processes without oxidative action. Both types are essential for maintaining product quality, preventing spoilage, and extending the shelf life of pulp and paper products.</p></p>
