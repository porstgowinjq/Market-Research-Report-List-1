<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Therapies for Cancer Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Somatic Cell Gene Therapy (SCGT)</li><li>Germline Gene Therapy (GGT)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cancer treatment gene therapy market is primarily divided into two types: Somatic Cell Gene Therapy (SCGT) and Germline Gene Therapy (GGT). SCGT targets non-reproductive cells, aiming to modify genes within the affected tissues to combat cancer directly, which is currently the more widely used approach. In contrast, GGT involves changes to reproductive cells, potentially affecting future generations, and is still mostly in research phases due to ethical and safety concerns. Both approaches aim to enhance cancer treatment effectiveness and patient outcomes.</p></p>
