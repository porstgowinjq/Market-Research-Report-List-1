<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Desalination Plants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Seawater</li><li>Brackish water</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Desalination plants can be classified into two main market types: seawater and brackish water. Seawater desalination plants extract freshwater from ocean water, addressing the needs of coastal regions where freshwater is scarce. They typically use advanced technologies like reverse osmosis or multi-stage flash distillation. In contrast, brackish water desalination targets less salty water sources, such as estuaries or inland lakes, offering a cost-effective solution for agricultural or municipal use, with lower energy requirements compared to seawater processes.</p></p>
