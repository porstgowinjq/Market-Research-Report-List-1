<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tidal Power Plant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-library Unidirectional Station</li><li>Single-library Bi-directional Station</li><li>Double-library Bi-directional Station</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tidal power plants primarily operate under three market types based on their library configurations. A single-library unidirectional station generates electricity during high tide only, allowing water to flow in one direction through turbines. Meanwhile, a single-library bi-directional station utilizes both incoming and outgoing tides, enabling energy generation in both directions. In contrast, a double-library bi-directional station features two separate libraries, maximizing energy output by capturing tidal flow in both directions more efficiently, thus providing a more adaptable and productive energy solution.</p></p>
